<p>S.Senesi - sept 2022</p>
<dl>
<dt>Pre-requisites :</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>some basic knowledege of C-ESM-EP (i.e. organization of a C-ESM-EP home directory, concept of a 'comparison')</li>
<li>how to run a libIGCM simulation</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When running a simulation (yet only on irene and irene-rome) you can 
trigger the computation of a C-ESM-EP atlas based on one of the output 
types (Seasonal, TimeSeries, packed Output, or even Output on scratch 
for e.g. a TEST simulation). This works when using a libIGCM version 
from trunk with a release number &gt;= xxx</p>
<p>The atlas shows a series of the most recent time slices of the running simulation. Slices number and duration are tunable.</p>
<h2 id="basic-use">Basic use</h2>
<h3 id="init-phase">Init phase</h3>
<p>Because C-ESM-EP requires a number of software packages, C-ESM-EP uses TGCC's tool 'pcocc' (see <a href="https://pcocc.readthedocs.io/">https://pcocc.readthedocs.io/</a>) and you must tell pcocc where to find a relevant environment, by interactively issuing this command :</p>
<p>&gt; pcocc image import docker-archive:~igcmg/Tools/climaf/climaf_spirit_a.tar cesmep_container</p>
<p>This should be done only once by each user. The path above is correct at the time of writing and may change in the future.</p>
<h3 id="settings">Settings:</h3>
<p>Computing a C-ESM-EP atlas is triggered using parameter 'Cesmep' in section Post of the config.card, which can be set to :</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>TRUE, or &lt;nyears&gt;Y, for using the most efficient output type 
(among those which are generated by the simulation, so SE else TS else 
packed Outputs). The form &lt;nyears&gt;Y allows to explicitly set the 
atlas time slice duration</li>
<li>SE, TS, or Pack, for selecting explicitly an output type and its 
time slicing; that output type should be activated independently</li>
<li>AtEnd for running the atlas only at simulation end, from Output type
 data (this works for TEST simulation with output on scratch)</li>
<li>FALSE for deactivating any C-ESM-EP atlas (which is the default)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In section Post of the config.card parameter 'CesmepSlices' allows to
 set the number of time slices to show in atlas (it defaults to 8).</p>
<p>Example of config.card minimal content (in section 'Post'):</p>
<pre><code>#D- Activate C-ESM-EP atlas by setting Cesmep to TRUE or to a number of years
Cesmep=5Y
#D- How many time slices in C-ESM-EP atlas ?
# CesmepSlices=4</code></pre>
<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>
<p>The C-ESM-EP code (from a reference code version) is partially copied
 to $SUMBIT_DIR/cesemp_lite/, which becomes the root C-ESM-EP directory 
for that simulation.</p>
<p>The C-ESM-EP comparison that is ran is by default 'run_comparison' 
and, in directory cesmep_lite/, that comparison name is further prefixed
 by your JobName (this matters when looking for outputs, see below)</p>
<p>Except for case AtEnd , the atlas is computed each time a batch of 
output is available for the selected type, provided it allows to process
 a new time slice. Time slicing is aligned with simulation start date 
and complies with values for parameters CesmepSlices and CesmepPeriod..</p>
<h3 id="outputs">Outputs</h3>
<p>The standard output of last C-ESM-EP launch is availabe in 
$SUMBIT_DIR/cesemp_lite/libIGCM_post.out, and the output for each 
component is located, as for all C-ESM-EP runs, in the component 
directory</p>
<dl>
<dt>The atlas main page is available on thredds/work like for other 
C-ESM-EP simulation e.g., if JobName is 'myFG2', atlas main index can be
 found at:</dt>
<dd><p><a href="https://thredds-su.ipsl.fr/thredds/fileServer/tgcc_thredds/work/senesis/C-ESM-EP/myFG2_mycomparison_senesis/C-ESM-EP_myFG2_mycomparison.html">https://thredds-su.ipsl.fr/thredds/fileServer/tgcc_thredds/work/senesis/C-ESM-EP/myFG2_mycomparison_senesis/C-ESM-EP_myFG2_mycomparison.html</a></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The actual value for your simulation can be found in the file above, $SUMBIT_DIR/cesemp_lite/libIGCM_post.out</p>
<h2 id="advanced-use">Advanced use</h2>
<p>The version of C-ESM-EP code used is located by default (on Irene) at
 ~igcmg/Tools/cesmep; this can be changed using config.card's Post 
section's parameter 'CesmepCode';</p>
<p>The C-ESM-EP comparison used can be chosen using config.card's Post parameter 'CesmepComparison'.</p>
<p>The comparison 'components' are activated based on the simulation 
physical components; their list can be changed manually after running 
ins_job (in $SUMBIT_DIR/cesemp_lite/libIGCM_post.param, which fields are
 Cesmep code location, comparison name, simulation start date, cache 
location, components list)</p>
<p>At that stage, you may also change component parameters in component 
directories in $SUMBIT_DIR/cesemp_lite/. You may also make changes to 
the datasets_setup.py source for customizing the datasets to use; for 
that, you can make use of the variables available in comparison's 
directory file libIGCM_fixed_settings.py, as e.g. :</p>
<pre><code>root           = '/ccc/store/cont003/gen0826'
Login          = 'senesis'
TagName        = 'IPSLCM6'
SpaceName      = 'DEVT'
ExpType        = 'piControl'
ExperimentName = 'piCesmep'
OUT            = 'Analyse'
frequency      = 'monthly'
DateBegin      = '18500101'
CesmepSlices   = 4
CesmepPeriod   = 1</code></pre>
<dl>
<dt>which names are self-explanatory in C-ESM-EP and libIGCM contexts except these ones:</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>DateBegin : the simulation start date</li>
<li>CesmepPeriod : the duration of atlas time slices</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The location for CliMAF cache is dedicated to the simulation and is 
$CCCSCRATCHDIR/cesmep_climaf_caches/${OUT}_${TagName}_${SpaceName}_${ExperimentName}_${JobName}</p>
<h3 id="example-of-config.card-full-content">Example of config.card full content</h3>
<pre><code>#D- Activate C-ESM-EP atlas by setting Cesmep to TRUE or to a number of years
Cesmep=10Y
#D- Configure C-ESM-EP 'comparison' (defaults to standard_comparison)
CesmepComparison=run_comparison
#D- Tell where is C-ESM-EP source code 
CesmepCode=/ccc/cont003/home/igcmg/igcmg/Tools/cesmep/
#D- How many time slices in C-ESM-EP atlas ?
CesmepSlices=4</code></pre>
<h3 id="for-power-users">For power users</h3>
<p>Directory cesmep_lite/ does not include all files of a standard 
C-ESM-EP root directory, in order to save inodes (and this is achieved 
thanks to the PYTHONPATH set by libIGCM for running C-ESM-EP). If you 
wish to be able to modify such missing files for further customizing 
your run, just copy them in cesmep_lite/ and change them the way you 
like. This should occur after ins_job call and before submitting the 
simulation job.</p>
